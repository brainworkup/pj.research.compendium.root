	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} To investigate whether impaired young adults with {ADHD} symptoms always have a childhood-onset disorder in a population-based longitudinal study. {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS} Participants belonged to the 1993 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study, including 5249 individuals born in Pelotas, Brazil, in 1993. They were followed up to 18 to 19 years of age, with 81.3\% retention. The data analysis was performed between August 8, 2015, and February 5, 2016. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES} The {ADHD} status was first ascertained at 11 years of age using a screening instrument (hyperactivity subscale of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire) calibrated for a {DSM}-{IV} {ADHD} diagnosis based on clinical interviews with parents using the Development and Well-Being Assessment. At 18 to 19 years of age, {ADHD} diagnosis was derived using {DSM}-5 criteria, except age at onset. We estimated the overlap between these groups assessed at 11 and 18 to 19 years of age and the rates of markers of impairment in these 2 groups compared with those without {ADHD}.
{RESULTS} At 11 years of age, childhood {ADHD} (C-{ADHD}) was present in 393 individuals (8.9\%). At 18 to 19 years of age, 492 individuals (12.2\%) fulfilled all {DSM}-5 criteria for young adult {ADHD} ({YA}-{ADHD}), except age at onset. After comorbidities were excluded, the prevalence of {YA}-{ADHD} without comorbidities decreased to 256 individuals (6.3\%). Children with C-{ADHD} had a male preponderance not observed among children without {ADHD} (251 [63.9\%] vs 1930 [47.9\%] male, P {\textless} .001), whereas the {YA}-{ADHD} group had a female preponderance (192 [39.0\%] vs 1786 [50.4\%] male, P {\textless} .001). Both groups had increased levels of impairment in adulthood, as measured by traffic incidents, criminal behavior, incarceration, suicide attempts, and comorbidities. However, only 60 children (17.2\%) with {ADHD} continued to have {ADHD} as young adults, and only 60 young adults (12.6\%) with {ADHD} had the disorder in childhood.
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE} The findings of this study do not support the assumption that adulthood {ADHD} is necessarily a continuation of childhood {ADHD}. Rather, they suggest the existence of 2 syndromes that have distinct developmental trajectories.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} To investigate childhood risk factors and young adult functioning of individuals with persistent, remitted, and late-onset young adult {ADHD}. Editorial page 655 Related article page 705 Supplemental content at jamapsychiatry.com {DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS} The study sample was the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of 2232 twins born in England and Wales from January 1, 1994, to December 4, 1995. Evaluation of childhood {ADHD} (ages 5, 7, 10, and 12 years) included prenatal and perinatal factors, clinical characteristics, and aspects of the family environment. Among participants aged 18 years, {ADHD} symptoms and associated impairment, overall functioning, and other mental health disorders were examined. Data analysis was conducted from February 19 to September 10, 2015. {MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {AND} {MEASURES} Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder according to {DSM}-{IV} diagnostic criteria in childhood and {DSM}-5 diagnostic criteria in young adulthood.
{RESULTS} Of 2232 participants in the E-Risk Study, 2040 were included in the present analysis. In total, 247 individuals met diagnostic criteria for childhood {ADHD}; of these, 54 (21.9\%) also met diagnostic criteria for the disorder at age 18 years. Persistence was associated with more symptoms (odds ratio [{OR}], 1.11 [95\% {CI}, 1.04-1.19]) and lower {IQ} ({OR}, 0.98 [95\% {CI}, 0.95-1.00]). At age 18 years, individuals with persistent {ADHD} had more functional impairment (school/work: {OR}, 3.30 [95\% {CI}, 2.18-5.00], home/with friends: {OR}, 6.26 [95\% {CI}, 3.07-12.76]), generalized anxiety disorder ({OR}, 5.19 [95\% {CI}, 2.01-13.38]), conduct disorder ({OR}, 2.03 [95\% {CI}, 1.03-3.99]), and marijuana dependence ({OR}, 2.88 [95\% {CI}, 1.07-7.71]) compared with those whose {ADHD} remitted. Among 166 individuals with adult {ADHD}, 112 (67.5\%) did not meet criteria for {ADHD} at any assessment in childhood. Results from logistic regressions indicated that individuals with late-onset {ADHD} showed fewer externalizing problems ({OR}, 0.93 [95\% {CI}, 0.91-0.96]) and higher {IQ} ({OR}, 1.04 [95\% {CI}, 1.02-1.07]) in childhood compared with the persistent group. However, at age 18 years, those with late-onset {ADHD} demonstrated comparable {ADHD} symptoms and impairment as well as similarly elevated rates of mental health disorders.
{CONCLUSIONS} {AND} {RELEVANCE} We identified heterogeneity in the {DSM}-5 young adult {ADHD} population such that this group consisted of a large, late-onset {ADHD} group with no childhood diagnosis, and a smaller group with persistent {ADHD}. The extent to which childhood-onset and late-onset adult {ADHD} may reflect different causes has implications for genetic studies and treatment of {ADHD}.},
